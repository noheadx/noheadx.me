      <description>&lt;p&gt;A successful team is essential for the company and the group itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This question pops up sooner or later in any job interview: How do you imagine your perfect workplace?&#xA;Anybody has an idea of what and how they want to work if they could choose freely.&#xA;The most critical part is The T.E.A.M. (or To Evolve And Mingle)!&#xA;The people I&amp;rsquo;m spending more time with on weekdays than with my wife or my kid. The folks I&amp;rsquo;m trusting are doing their jobs the best way they can - just as they trust me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The mindset influences the success of a company - and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A company&amp;rsquo;s mindset is defined by how people work together, communicate, and view their work/product. An attractive attitude for me would be that people follow the Agile Manifesto daily, have an honest, open, and same-level type of communication, and are proud of their product, work, and company.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot; Please describe your ideal workplace&amp;quot; is a typical question in a job interview.&#xA;Even though it seems like a standard question to check if the candidate would be a match, the actual intent of this question is to see if the candidate has a clear opinion on his working environment and can articulate that.&#xA;So, whenever I&amp;rsquo;m hiring for a dev/DevOps/it position, this question will eventually pop up at one point or another during the process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
