It's 2025, 12 years after "The Phoenix Project". Yet, there are companies that seem to be unaware of product and development culture.

# Responsibility of Few

A few weeks ago, I spoke to a CEO of a small IT company who complained to me about the performance of their dev team - developers wouldn't keep the deadlines (the ones they didn't set), they would just work on what they want, and (a classic) never finish any feature. 

This had created a huge backlog of unfinished features and unhandled technical debt with important customer projects, hence resulting in unsatisfied customers. The company's mid-term target was to scale but the CEO was afraid that adding more projects, products and people would ruin the company in its current state. 

The CEO insisted that a performance culture needs to be established by enforcing the developers to finish and deliver features! The bad company evaluations on Glassdoor only strengthened his confidence that the developers were ruining the company.

My first reaction was: Wow - it's 2025, and we're really still discussing the "performance" of dev teams from a sales perspective? I thought the era of "us vs. them"  was finally over?! That the prejudice of the lazy developer doing only the work they want and the hard-working salesman who keeps the company alive but gets no credit from the rest of the company for closing contracts that pays their salary. There are probably more books, TED talks and blog articles on that subject than anyone could consume in their lives. Countless companies have documented their pains of aligning business, engineering, operations, and IT - you can't miss it unless you've spent the past 15 years in a cave. 

But then I gave it a second thought...

## The 2025 Reality Check

Maybe the cave metaphor wasn't entirely fair. The real issue is that we're still treating symptoms while the underlying disease spreads unchecked. It becomes evident, when we look at research from 2024/2025, and what it actually tells us about situations like this.

### What We Know About Developer Productivity

[McKinsey's research](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/developer-velocity-how-software-excellence-fuels-business-performance) on Developer Velocity identifies four capabilities that have the greatest impact on business performance: 
* tools, 
* culture, 
* product management, and 
* talent management. 

Notice what's missing from that list? Enforcement - Pressure - Demanding developers to "finish features."

In fact, the data shows the opposite: Organizations with strong developer tools 
* are **65% more innovative** than bottom-quartile companies! 
* They also have **47% higher developer satisfaction and retention rates**! 

That's not about cracking the whip - it's about removing obstacles.

When velocity metrics are used as performance indicators, they don't improve performance, but rather destroy collaboration. Developers start [gaming the system](https://uplevelteam.com/blog/measuring-developer-velocity), optimizing for looking productive rather than being productive. Teams avoid necessary refactoring work that might slow their velocity numbers but would improve long-term quality. So, tell me: how long does speed matter when quality suffers?

And perhaps most damning for my CEO-Buddy's theory: [Research](https://www.infoq.com/news/2024/01/engineering-productivity-metrics/) across 17 leading tech companies shows they don't use wholesale adoption of frameworks like DORA or SPACE. Instead, they develop context-specific metrics that actually illuminate problems rather than create new ones. 

Not a single one of them measures "enforcement of feature completion."

### The Developer Experience Dimension

Let's revisit the CEO's complaints through a different lens. Developers "just work on what they want" and "never finish features." That's not laziness or lack of discipline, but rather a rational response to an irrational environment!

The [DevEx framework](https://www.infoq.com/articles/devex-metrics-framework/), developed by the people behind DORA and SPACE, focuses on three critical dimensions: feedback loops, cognitive load, and flow state. When developers constantly switch between unfinished features, when they're working on technical debt instead of new features, when they seem to be working on "what they want" - they might actually be trying to manage impossible cognitive load or fix broken feedback loops that leadership can't see.

Technical debt is a perfect example. To non-technical leadership, it often looks like developers wasting time on invisible work when they should be building features customers are asking for. But organizations with dedicated technical debt management achieve 27% higher velocity over time compared to those who address debt reactively. That's not developers being stubborn - that's developers trying to prevent the entire system from collapsing.

The pattern of "never finishing features" is equally telling. When developers consistently fail to complete work, it's rarely because they're incompetent or unmotivated. It's usually because:
- The scope was unrealistic from the start
- Requirements changed mid-development (often based on sales promises)
- Technical dependencies weren't understood or communicated
- The definition of "done" differs between sales, product, and engineering

None of these are solved by enforcement.

### The Leadership Blind Spot

Here's the uncomfortable truth: Few leaders understand the day-to-day developer experience. They don't see the context switching, the interruptions, the cascade of dependencies, the technical constraints. They see outputs - or the lack of them - and assume the problem is motivation or capability.

The 2024 DORA report emphasizes something critical: Organizations that prioritize user-centric approaches and work under transformational leadership with clear strategic direction consistently outperform others. Not organizations that enforce. Not organizations that pressure. Organizations that lead.

And those Glassdoor reviews the CEO cited as evidence against the developers? They're actually evidence of the real problem. When employee reviews are consistently negative, it's not validation that employees are the problem. It's a screaming alarm that leadership has created an environment where people can't do their best work.

Poor leadership communication alone leads to a 25% reduction in team productivity. When leaders fail to articulate goals or expectations clearly, when they create environments where developers are blamed for systemic failures, they're not solving problems - they're multiplying them.

### What Actually Causes This Scenario

Dysfunctional leadership teams become serious drags on strategy execution and erode morale. This particular scenario has all the hallmarks:

**Misaligned Incentives**: Sales is rewarded for signing contracts, regardless of feasibility. Engineering is blamed when they can't deliver what was promised. There's no shared accountability for realistic commitments.

**Communication Breakdown**: Developers apparently don't set their own deadlines. This means someone else is setting them without the technical context to understand what's realistic. Then everyone is surprised when reality doesn't match the arbitrary timeline.

**Blame Culture**: The entire framing is about what developers are doing wrong. Not what the organization is doing wrong. Not what sales is doing wrong. Not what leadership is doing wrong. Just developers.

**Missing Psychological Safety**: In healthy organizations, developers can say "this timeline is unrealistic" without fear. They can say "we need to address technical debt" without being accused of working on what they want. They can have honest conversations about capacity and complexity.

**Lack of Clear Priorities**: A huge backlog of unfinished features suggests everything is a priority, which means nothing is a priority. That's a leadership failure, not a developer failure.

### The Scaling Paradox

The CEO was right about one thing: They can't scale in their current state. But here's the paradox - enforcing developers to finish features would make scaling even harder.

Scaling requires:
- Systems that can handle increased load (requires addressing technical debt)
- Processes that work with more people (requires realistic planning and clear priorities)
- Culture that attracts and retains talent (requires psychological safety and good tooling)
- Alignment across functions (requires communication and shared understanding)

Enforcement provides exactly none of these. It actually undermines all of them.

Organizations that successfully scale invest in developer experience. They reduce cognitive load. They fix broken feedback loops. They create environments where flow state is possible. They align business and engineering goals rather than pitting them against each other.

Companies that try to scale by pressuring developers to work faster hit a wall. The technical debt accumulates faster. The good developers leave. The ones who stay are the ones who've learned to game whatever metrics leadership is using. Quality plummets. Customer satisfaction drops. And leadership blames developers for not working hard enough.

### What Would Actually Help

If I could sit down with this CEO again, here's what I'd suggest:

**Start with joint planning sessions** between sales, product, and engineering. Before any commitment is made to a customer, engineering needs to weigh in on feasibility, scope, and timeline. Sales needs to understand technical constraints. This isn't bureaucracy - it's basic risk management.

**Let developers set their own commitments**. They're the ones doing the work. They understand the complexity. When people commit to their own goals, they're far more likely to achieve them than when goals are imposed on them.

**Invest in tools and reducing cognitive load**. Ask developers what's slowing them down. Is it a painful deployment process? Inadequate test environments? Constant interruptions? Poor documentation? Fix those things.

**Measure outcomes, not activity**. Stop tracking whether developers are "finishing features" and start tracking whether customers are getting value. Those aren't always the same thing. Sometimes the most valuable thing a developer can do is prevent a disaster by addressing technical debt.

**Create psychological safety**. Developers need to be able to say "this won't work" or "we need more time" or "this approach has technical problems" without being labeled as difficult or uncommitted. If you punish honesty, you'll get silence instead.

**Listen before enforcing**. Talk to the developers. Not to tell them what they're doing wrong, but to understand what they're experiencing. What obstacles are they facing? What would help them be more effective? You might be surprised by what you learn.

## The Real Cave

The CEO has been in a cave, but it's not a technology cave or a business trends cave. It's a cave of outdated management thinking where control trumps empowerment, where activity matters more than outcomes, where the answer to every problem is to demand people work harder or faster.

The research is clear. The evidence is overwhelming. The successful companies have figured this out. High-performing organizations don't enforce - they enable. They don't pressure - they prioritize. They don't blame - they build.

In 2025, we know what works. The question is whether leadership is willing to do it.

The responsibility doesn't belong to the few developers failing to finish features. It belongs to the leadership that created the conditions where finishing features became impossible.

And until that changes, scaling will remain a distant dream - no matter how much enforcement is applied.

## A Note on Business Reality

Let me be clear: I understand the CEO's perspective. Revenue needs to grow. Margins need to improve. Customers need to be satisfied. Investors or boards expect results. These aren't abstract concepts - they're survival requirements for any company. A CEO can't afford to ignore financial performance.

But here's what needs to be understood: Investing in developer experience isn't about creating comfort zones or protecting developers from pressure. It's not about letting engineers work on whatever interests them academically. It's about removing the obstacles that prevent your engineering organization from delivering business value efficiently.

When developers have the right tools, clear priorities, and realistic timelines, they deliver more value faster. When technical debt is managed proactively, the cost of new features decreases over time instead of increasing. When there's psychological safety, problems surface early when they're cheap to fix, not late when they're expensive disasters. When sales and engineering align on what's feasible, customer promises get kept and satisfaction increases.

Developer experience is a business investment with measurable returns. Companies with high developer velocity show significantly better business performance. The evidence shows they're more innovative, more profitable, and better positioned for growth. This isn't about being nice to developers. It's about building an organization capable of executing on business goals.

The choice isn't between developer happiness and business results. The choice is between short-term pressure that undermines long-term capability, and building the organizational foundation that makes sustained growth possible. One approach might feel like action. The other actually works.
