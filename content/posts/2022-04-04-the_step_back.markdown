## Taking a Step Back to Leap Forward: A Reflection on Career Choices
In my recent professional journey, I find myself assuming a new position, a role that some might perceive as a step back – the position of a __Director of Engineering__. Glancing at my CV, one might observe a pattern of transitioning roles every 2-3 years, each shift motivated by distinct reasons, but that's a discussion for another post.
Why this apparent downgrade, you might wonder? Certainly not out of desperation. The CTO job market is thriving, with numerous companies actively seeking individuals for such roles. Over the past months alone, I've been approached by 10-20 companies interested in hiring a CTO. So, what's the rationale behind this move?

### Reevaluating Titles and Motivation
The _first and foremost reason_ is my belief in roles and responsibilities over mere titles. Regardless of the golden tags bestowed upon a position, it's the fulfillment of duties that genuinely matters. Much like a movie set, every organization requires a diverse set of roles – actors, directors, make-up artists, and more. The synergy of each role contributes to the overall success. Titles, for me, are not motivations or rewards; they are markers of specific responsibilities that need to be fulfilled.

### Navigating Diverse Interpretations of Roles
The _second reason_ stems from the diverse interpretations of roles across different companies. I've encountered companies that strategically define the CTO role, segregating operational responsibilities from it and leaving only architects and designers. Conversely, in startup environments, a CTO might be hands-on, engaged in tasks ranging from hiring developers to negotiating contracts and managing infrastructure. While my inclination aligns with the former, the varying demands of company size, time to market, and financial constraints might necessitate a CTO of the latter. Staying true to my beliefs narrows potential employers, but it's a conscious choice for alignment.

### Prioritizing Impact
The _third reason_ revolves around the impact of the role. Despite the shift, my innate desire to fundamentally impact industries or people's lives remains unwavering. The luxury of earning a living from something inherently enjoyable, like technology, should be harnessed to do good in the world. Changing the world remains a driving force behind my professional choices.
Taking on a role that might seem "beneath" me is a deliberate move, part of a reflective review of my professional trajectory. It prompts questions about lessons learned and the effectiveness of aligning organizational change with technology when focusing on a specific facet rather than the entire spectrum.

### The Power of Prioritization
Drawing from experience, focusing on one aspect ensures its success but often at the expense of other priorities. Prioritization, a familiar concept in managing workloads, becomes a tool for structural clarity. In my professional life, this translates into a focused approach while maintaining the ability to face myself in the mirror every morning.
This step back is not a regression but a strategic move – exploring whether concentrating on specific areas can yield more impactful results. It's a deliberate step to reassess, realign, and ultimately take a leap forward in the ever-evolving landscape of technology and leadership.
